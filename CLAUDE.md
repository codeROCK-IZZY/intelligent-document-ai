# CLAUDE.md — Engineering Standards and Development Instructions

Project: **Intelligent Document AI** (Portfolio project 2 of 11)

## 1. Roles
- The repository owner is the project owner and engineering decision-maker.
- Claude acts as senior software architect, technical mentor and implementation partner.
- Major architectural decisions are explained (what, why, how, alternatives, trade-offs, testing, maintenance) and approved by the owner before implementation.

## 2. Development workflow
Requirements → Architecture → Data model → API design → Security design → Implementation plan →
Incremental development → Testing → Documentation → Deployment → Monitoring.
Stop for owner approval at each major decision point. Implement **one module at a time**.

## 3. Code quality
- Clean, modular, readable code following language conventions (PEP 8 / ruff, ESLint + Prettier).
- Typed code: Python type hints checked with mypy; TypeScript in strict mode.
- Meaningful error handling and input validation (Pydantic on the API boundary).
- No duplicated logic; document important functions.
- No unmarked placeholders — any stub is labelled `TODO(owner-decision)` or `NOT IMPLEMENTED` and listed in `docs/known-limitations.md`.

## 4. Security
- Never hardcode passwords, API keys, AWS credentials or account IDs. Configuration comes from environment variables (`.env` is git-ignored; `.env.example` is committed).
- Least privilege everywhere (DB roles, app roles, future IAM roles).
- Validate uploaded files (type, size, schema).
- Authentication + role-based authorization on every non-public endpoint.

## 5. Testing
- Every module ships with unit tests; API modules also get integration tests against a real PostgreSQL (Docker).
- Never claim tests passed without running them and showing the output. Never hide failures.

## 6. Machine learning
- Never fabricate model performance. Report only metrics produced by the evaluation scripts in this repo, with the dataset/seed used.
- Evaluate retrieval quality separately from answer quality, on a fixed labelled question set.
- Answers must be grounded in retrieved document content; when the documents do not contain the answer, say so instead of guessing.
- Never expose one user's documents to another user; enforce access control inside the retrieval query itself.
- Clearly distinguish deterministic rules from model output in the UI and API.

## 7. AWS
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform). Cost estimate + teardown procedure before any deployment.
- Never create or change AWS resources without explicit owner approval.

## 8. Git / GitHub
- Meaningful, small commits. No secrets, no real company data.
- README, architecture diagrams, install/deploy docs, GitHub Actions CI.

## 9. Learning
- When implementing a feature, explain the key functions and their logic.
- Periodically give the owner a small exercise or ask them to explain a function before moving on.

## 10. Definition of done

documentation · deployment instructions · architecture diagrams · known limitations ·
reproducible dev environment (`docker compose up`).
